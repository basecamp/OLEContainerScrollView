# OLEContainerScrollView

A `UIScrollView` subclass that intelligently handles multiple child scroll views and does not interfere with UIKit ºs cell reuse functionality.

## Blog Post

Please read my [blog post about OLEContainerScrollView](http://oleb.net/blog/2014/05/scrollviews-inside-scrollviews/) for details about the implementation.

## Demo App

To check out the demo app:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `OLEContainerScrollViewDemo.xcodeproj` in Xcode.

The demo app uses a class I have written named `OLESimulatedTableView` to illustrate how a `UITableView` reuses its cells.
